     <h1>"We believe learning is the source of human progress.
     It has the power to transform our world
     from illness to health, 
     from poverty to prosperity,
     from conflict to peace.
     It has the power to transform our lives
     for ourselves,
     for our families,
     for our communities.
     No matter who we are or where we are,
     learning empowers us to change and grow
     and redefine what is possible.
     That is why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege. 
     And that is why  is here.
     We partner with the best institutions
     to bring the best learning
     to every corner of the world.
     So that anyone, anywhere has the power to 
     transform their lives through learning."
